export const DEFAULT_MARKDOWN = `# Marked React - Markdown Parser for React

[Marked React] lets you render [Markdown] into react without using [dangerouslySetInnerHTML]. It uses [marked] under the hood to parse markdown.

Markdown is a simple text format whose goal is to be very easy to read and write, even when not converted to HTML. This demo page will let you type anything you like and see how it gets converted. Live. No more waiting around.

## How To Use The Demo

1. Type in stuff on the control panel.
2. See the live updates on the storybook.

That's it. Pretty simple.

## Why Markdown?

It's easy. It's not overly bloated, unlike HTML. Also, as the creator of [markdown] says,

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.
